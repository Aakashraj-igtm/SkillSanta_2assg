        <p>The concept of IIT was first introduced by Sh. N.M.Sircar, then member of Education on Viceroy's executive council. Following his recommendations, the first Indian Institute of Technology was established in the year 1950 in Kharagpur. In his report, Shri Sircar had suggested that such Institutes should also be started in different parts of the country. The Government having accepted these recommendations of the Sircar Committee decided to establish more Institutes of Technology with the assistance of friendly countries who were prepared to help. The first offer of help came from USSR who agreed to collaborate in the establishment of an Institute through UNESCO at Bombay. This was followed by the Institutes of Technology at Madras, Kanpur and Delhi with collaborations with West Germany, United States and UK respectively. Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati was established in 1994 and the University of Roorkee was converted into an IIT in 2001.[4]

            H.R.H. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh during his visit to India, laid the foundation stone of the college at Hauz Khas on 28 January 1959. The first admissions were made in 1961. The College of Engineering & Technology was registered as a society on 14 June 1960 under the Societies Registration Act No. XXI of 1860 (Registration No. S1663 of 1960–61). The students were asked to report at the college on 16 August 1961, and the college was formally inaugurated on 17 August 1961 by Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research & Cultural Affairs. Initially, the college ran in the Kashmiri Gate campus of Delhi College of Engineering (now known as Delhi Technological University) before shifting to its permanent campus in Hauz Khas. The Department of Textile Technology of Delhi College of Engineering was shifted out en-block to mark the beginning of the IIT Delhi at its new campus at Hauz Khas. The college was later accorded the status of a university and was renamed as Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</p>
